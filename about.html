            stories of coffee from around the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean
            to brew - in every shipment.</p>

          <p class="commitment__description">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the
            way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at
            the source. To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to
            understand the challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee
            growers and empower a global community of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also
            offer training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
            finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.

          <p class="quality__description">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest
            and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking
            the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast
            consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
